                  I'm passionate junior Django(Backend) and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) developer with a strong interest in web development and emerging technologies. What I love most about web development is the continuous learning it requires. I'm constantly exploring new libraries, frameworks, and tools to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I believe that staying updated with the latest tools and techniques is crucial for success in this field.


If you're looking for a dedicated Django, MERN developer or Full Stack developer who is eager to contribute, learn, and grow, I would love to connect. Feel free to reach out to me through email or connect with me on LinkedIn.

                    In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of settings — from advertising agencies and large corporations to start-ups and small digital product studios. Additionally, I also released a <strong style={{ color: "#6366f1" }}>comprehensive video course</strong> a few years ago, guiding learners through building a web app with the Spotify API.
